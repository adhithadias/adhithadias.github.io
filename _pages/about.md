<span style="color:blue">*I am actively seeking internship opportunities, preferably research-oriented, for the summer of 2025, with a focus on compilers, programming languages, and high-performance computing. Email: kadhitha@purdue.edu*</span>

I am a graduate student in Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working under the guidance of [Prof. Milind Kulkarni]({{"https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/"}}). My research interests span systems, compilers, and high-performance computing, with my current work focusing on optimized code generation for sparse tensor algebra operations.

I earned my Bachelor's degree with Honors in Engineering (B.Sc.(Hons.) in Engineering) from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, where I completed my thesis on "Deep Learning through Augmented Reality-Based User Interaction for Collaborative Automation" under the supervision of
[Dr. Ranga Rodrigo]({{"https://ranga.staff.uom.lk/"}}).

During my undergraduate studies, I interned at the LiveLabs Urban Lifestyle Innovation Platform at the School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University. Under the supervision of
[Prof. Jie Xiong]({{"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GR9VzaMAAAAJ&hl=en"}}) and
[Prof. Youngki Lee]({{"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhKU0oMAAAAJ&hl=en"}}), I worked on Human-Computer Interaction and Wi-Fi-based indoor localization using direction-of-arrival estimation techniques.

Following graduation, I worked as a Software Engineer at Sysco LABS, Sri Lanka, where I contributed to the development and maintenance of applications for Sysco Corporation, USA.

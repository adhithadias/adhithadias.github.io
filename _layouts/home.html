<p><span style="color:blue"><em>I am actively seeking internship opportunities, preferably research-oriented, for the summer of 2025, with a focus on compilers, programming languages, and high-performance computing.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Purdue University, with a broad interest in compilers, programming languages, and high-performance computing. I am advised by [Prof. Milind Kulkarni]({{"https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/"}}). My current research focuses on developing compile-time optimizations for sparse tensor algebra computations, aiming to enhance computational efficiency.
